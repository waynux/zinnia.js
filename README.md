zinnia.js
=========

Zinnia.js is a porting version of Zinnia(http://zinnia.sourceforge.net/).


How to Use
==========

Download the language model from https://tegaki.github.io/, and put it under ./zinnia.js/

The default path of model is "handwriting-zh_TW.model", fix it (at the last line of /lib/zinnia.js) if you need another language recognizer.

Open the index.html on Firefox.
